Transform my current Loudoun County zoning chat prototype into a County Planning Staff Assistant tool. This is a B2G product for government employees, NOT for public use.

## Current State
- Simple chat interface querying 600-page zoning PDF
- No user authentication or parcel awareness
- Basic Q&A responses

## Required Transformation

### 1. UI Layout Changes
Create a two-column professional interface:

LEFT PANEL - "Query Information":
- Parcel ID input field (required - format: XXX-XX-XXXX)
- Property address field (auto-populate from parcel if possible)
- Query category dropdown: [Permitted Use, Setbacks, Special Exceptions, Overlays, Historic Districts, Other]
- Case reference field (optional - for precedent lookups)
- Staff member name/ID field

RIGHT PANEL - "Response & Documentation":
- AI response area with:
  - Clear section citations (clickable to source)
  - Relevant ordinance quotes in gray boxes
  - "Additional Considerations" section for overlays/special districts
  - Orange disclaimer box: "For official determinations, consult Planning Director"
- Action buttons below response:
  - "Export as PDF" (includes query, response, timestamp, staff ID)
  - "Save to Case File"
  - "Email to Constituent"
  - "Flag for Legal Review"

### 2. Backend Functionality

PARCEL CONTEXT (mock for demo):
- When parcel ID entered, display mock data:
  - Base zoning: (e.g., "AR-1")
  - Overlays: (e.g., "Limestone Overlay District")
  - Special Districts: (e.g., "None")
  - Previous permits: (e.g., "SUP-2023-001: Home Business approved")

RESPONSE ENHANCEMENT:
- Every response must include:
  1. Direct answer
  2. Specific ordinance sections referenced
  3. Any modifying overlays or exceptions
  4. "See also:" related sections

AUDIT SYSTEM:
- Log every query with:
  - Timestamp
  - Staff ID
  - Parcel ID
  - Query text
  - Response provided
- Display "Session ID: [timestamp-based ID]" at bottom

### 3. Common Query Templates

Add quick-access buttons for top 5 queries:
- "Can I subdivide this parcel?"
- "What businesses are permitted?"
- "What are the setback requirements?"
- "Is this use allowed by Special Exception?"
- "What's the maximum building height?"

When clicked, pre-populate the chat with the template question.

### 4. Demo Data

Create 3 sample parcels with different characteristics:
- Parcel 123-45-6789: AR-1 zoning, Limestone Overlay
- Parcel 234-56-7890: TR-10 zoning, Historic District
- Parcel 345-67-8901: PD-CC zoning, no overlays

### 5. Professional Styling
- County seal/logo placeholder at top
- Government-appropriate colors (navy, gray, white)
- Clear typography (no chat bubbles - use structured sections)
- "INTERNAL USE ONLY - NOT FOR PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION" header

### 6. Analytics Dashboard (Simple Mock)
Add "Stats" tab showing:
- Queries today: [counter]
- Most asked about sections: [list]
- Average response time saved: "~12 minutes per query"

The goal is to demonstrate how this tool makes county staff more efficient and legally compliant, NOT to be a public-facing chatbot. Every feature should scream "professional government tool."

Keep the existing RAG/chat functionality but wrap it in this government-focused UI/UX.
